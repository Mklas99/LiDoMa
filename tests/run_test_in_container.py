"""
Docker Container-based Installation Test

This script runs inside a Docker container to safely test the Docker installation functions.
The container provides an isolated environment where the installation code can be executed
without affecting the host system.

Key features:
- Tests the real installation code with a DRY_RUN flag
- Runs in an isolated container environment
- Outputs detailed logs of what would happen during installation
- Verifies that the installation script generates the expected commands

Usage:
- Don't run this script directly; use run_container_test.bat which will:
  1. Build the Docker test container
  2. Mount the codebase into the container
  3. Run this script inside the container
